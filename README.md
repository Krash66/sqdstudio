Design Studio Database Tool   VB.NET

VB.NET Database tool for mapping unlike databases and generating scripts in propietary language to run back end services.
Tool installs with a blank Access DB and a Loaded Sample Access DB as well as DDL structures to build databases in SQL Server, 
DB2 or Oracle. Setup whatever database you want then create an ODBC database DSN pointing to it and this tool will use it to 
create and build projects.. It also uses AdFlow as a graphical tool to build projects.

Program has it's own FTP client, Database DML browser, XML message to DTD converter, Modeller to model any DB table structure (with type converter) into any other (ex: DB2 to SQL server, Oracle to DB2, etc....) and ODBC DSN browser.

Enjoy!
