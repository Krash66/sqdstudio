To use this Sample in the easiest manner, use the following Setup directions.

1. Move or Copy this entire folder (\SQDataSample) to the root of c:\ as this project is based around a location of C:\SQDataSample

2. Create a New ODBC DSN entry for Sample.mdb. This is an MS Access Database so use the basic (.mdb)MS Access Driver in ODBC

3. Open Design Studio, Open a Project and Click the 'Change' Button to change the ODBC DSN to the Entry you just created.

4. Click the 'Change' Button at the bottom of the 'Open Project' Dialog and choose the Test Project already Built.

5. Now you can experiment with the Already Built Sample Project AND Create Test Projects of your own.
