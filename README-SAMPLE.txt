To use this Sample in the easiest manner, use the following Setup directions.

1. Move or Copy this entire folder (\SQDataSample) to the root of C:\ as this project is based around a location of C:\SQDataSample.

2. Create a New ODBC System DSN named 'SQData Sample' and select the 'Sample.mdb' in this directory. This is an MS Access Database so use the basic (.mdb) MS Access Driver in the ODBC Administrator.

3. Open Design Studio.

4. Using the File Menu, Select Open a Project.

5. Click the upper Change Button in the Open Project Dialog and choose 'SQData Sample' as the MetaData Source for the ODBC entry you just created.

6. Click the lower Change Button in the Open Project Dialog and choose 'Test Project'.

7. Now you can experiment with the Sample Project AND Create test Projects of your own.
